## Description
### The objective of this project is to create a slider of cards given an array of objects with each card information.
1. Given an array of objects with the title, description, background color and an image URL, the app will print a card for each object.
2. With a State Hook that controlls the step that the user currently is, the Card component which is rendered will be different.
3. To create the slide effect, every card will be printed, but its overflow will be hidden. So every time the user selects a new step, the card will translate-x a 100% multiplied by the current step. This will create the slider effect.
